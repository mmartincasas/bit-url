## üîí Security Considerations

### 1. **Supabase Database Setup**:
To get the project running, you need to create your own **Supabase account** and set up a database. Follow these steps:

- Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.io) and create a free account.
- Create a new project and get your **API URL** and **API Key**.
- In the **Supabase dashboard**, create a table to store your URLs. This table should have at least the following columns:
  - A column to store the **original URL**
  - A column to store the **short code**

### 2. **Creating the `.env` file**:
After setting up your Supabase project, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_url>
SUPABASE_KEY=<your_supabase_key>
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000   # Or use your deployed URL in production
```
